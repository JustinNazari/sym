  spec.description = <<-EOF
    Sym is a versatile command line utility and a library, that streamlines access to a 
    symmetric encryption offered by OpenSSL library. Use its rich CLI interface, or the Ruby 
    API to generate a key used for both encryption and decryption. You can 
    additionally password protect the key, and optionally store the key in the named 
    OS-X keychain. Use the key to reliably encrypt, decrypt and re-encrypt your application 
    secrets. Use the -t CLI switch to open an encrypted file in an editor of your choice. 
    Sym uses a symmetric aes-256-cbc cipher with a private key and an IV vector.

Thank you for installing this gem! 
To enable bash command line completion, please run the following 
command, which appends sym's shell completion to the specified file:

  sym --bash-completion ~/.bash_profile 

(or any other shell initialization file of your preference).

Thank you for checking out Sym and happy crypting :)
