## Summary

What? *Another security gem?* —— Well, funny you should ask! 

You see, security is an incredibly wide topic. The tools around security tend to fall into two classes: swiss army knife wrappers around `OpenSSL`, and more specialized tools. This gem falls in the second category. It wraps a very small part of `OpenSSL` library. 

> __Namely, `secrets-cipher-base64` provides:__
>
> * Symmetric data encryption with: 
>   * the cipher `AES-256-CBC` 
>   * 256-bit private key
>   * which can be optionally password-encrypted.
> * Rich command line interface with some innovative features, such as inline encrypted file editing using your current `$EDITOR`
> * Automatic compression of the data
> * Rich Ruby API and highly extensible approach to encryption/decryption
> * 

The point behind this gem is to allow you to store sensitive application secrets in your source code repo as `AES-256-CBC`-encrypted strings (this is the same encryption algorithm that US Government uses for internal encryption). The output of the encryption is always a (strict) `base64`-encoded string, without the linebreaks.
 
The private key (encrypted or not) is also a base64-encoded string. 
 
Using a single-line string that `strict_base64` generates, makes this gem well fit for encrypting specific fields in the YAML file.  Similarly, using the same encoding for the private key means it can be easily exported as an environment variable.  
 
> NOTE: The library leverages the code shown in the following discussion: http://stuff-things.net/2015/02/12/symmetric-encryption-with-ruby-and-rails/ Thanks to the author of the above thread for demonstrating it.

## Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption simply means that we are using the same private key to encrypt and decrypt. The secret can be generated by the tool and is a *base64-encoded* string which is 45 characters long (including the newline). The *base64-decoded* secret is always 32 characters long (or 256 bytes long).

In addition to the private key, the encryption uses an IV vector. The library completely hides `iv` from the user, generates one random `iv` per encryption, and stores it together with the field itself (*base64-encoded*).

## Installation

If you plan on using the library in your ruby project with Bundler managing its dependencies, just include the following line in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'secrets-cipher-base64'
```
And then run `bundle`.

Or install it into the global namespace with `gem install` command:

    $ gem install secrets-cipher-base64
    $ secrets -h

## Usage

### Configuration

The library offers a typical `Secrets::Configuration` class which can be used to tweak some of the internals of the gem. This is really meant for a very advanced user who knows what she is doing. The following snippet is actually part of the Configuration class itself, but can be overridden by your code that uses and initializes this library. `Configuration` is a singleton, so changes to it will propagate to any subsequent calls to the gem.

```ruby
Secrets::Configuration.configure do |config|
  config.password_cipher = 'AES-128-CBC'  # 
  config.data_cipher = 'AES-256-CBC'
  config.private_key_cipher = config.data_cipher
  config.compression_enabled = true
  config.compression_level = Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION
end
```

As you can see, it's possible to change the default cipher typem, although not all ciphers will be code-compatible with the current algorithm, and may require additional code changes.

### Private Keys

This library relies on the existance of the 32-byte private key (aka, *a secret*), that must be stored somewhere safely if your encrypted data is to be persisted, for example it can be saved into the keychain on Mac OSX. 

> In fact, we put together a separate file that discusses strategies for protecting your encryption keys, for example you can read about [how to use Mac OS-X Keychain Access application](https://github.com/kigster/secrets-cipher-base64/blob/master/MANAGING-KEYS.md) and other methods. Additions and discussion are welcome. Please contribute!

You can use one key for all encrypted fields, or many keys – perhaps one per deployment environment, etc. While you can have per-field secrets, it seems like an overkill.

__NOTE: it is considered a bad practice to check in the private key into the version control.__  If you keep your secret out of your repo, you can check-in encrypted secrets file directly into the repo. As long as the private key itself is safe, the data in your encrypted  will be next to impossible to extract. 

### Generating Private Keys
 
You can generate using the command line, or in a programmatic way. 

#### 1. Command Line

Once the gem is installed you will be able to run an executable `secrets`:

```bash
gem install secrets-cipher-base64
# then let's generate and copy the secret to clipboard
secrets -gc

# or save a new key into a bash variable
SECRET=$(secrets -g)

# or create a password-protected key, and save it to a file:
secrets -gcp -o ~/.secret
New Password:     *********
Confirm Password: ********* 
```

You can subsequently use the private key by either:

 1. passing the -k 'key value' to the command line
 2. passing the -K <filename> to the command line

NOTE: If you installed the gem with bundler, make sure to prefix the above commands with `bundle exec`).

#### 2. Ruby

Upon including the `Secrets` module, each ruby class will receive it's own method `#private_key` and `#create_private_key`. The latter will generate a new key each time it's called, the former will either assign a key, or generate and save it in the class instance variable. Therefore each class including `Secrets` will use it's own key (unless the key is assigned).

```ruby
require 'secrets'
@secret = Secrets.create_private_key # generates a new key every time it's called
# OR
@secret = Secrets.private_key        # generates a new key and saves it
@secret.eql?(Secrets.private_key)    # => true

class TestClass
  include Secrets
end

@secret.eql?(TestClass.private_key)  # => false (a new key is saved in the class)

class SomeClass
  include Secrets
  secret Secrets.private_key
end

@secret.eql?(SomeClass.private_key)  # => true (it was assigned)
```
### Encrypting and Decrypting Data

As before, we'll first show how to encrypt raw data or files using the tool, and then show how to do the same in Ruby.

#### 1. CLI

This may be a good time to show the full help message for the `secrets` tool:

```bash
❯ exe/secrets -h
Usage:
    secrets [options]
Modes:
    -g, --generate                generate a new private key
    -e, --encrypt                 encrypt

    -N, --no-color                disable color output
    -h, --help                    show help
```

##### CLI Examples

```bash
  Examples:

# generate a new secret:
export KEY=$(secrets -g)
echo $KEY
75ngenJpB6zL47/8Wo7Ne6JN1pnOsqNEcIqblItpfg4=

# encrypt a plain text string with the key:
export ENCRYPTED=$(secrets -e -s "secret string" -k $KEY)
echo $ENCRYPTED
Y09MNDUyczU1S0UvelgrLzV0RTYxZz09CkBDMEw4Q0R0TmpnTm9md1QwNUNy%T013PT0K

# decrypt a previously encrypted string:
secrets -d -s $ENCRYPTED -k $KEY
secret string

# encrypt a file:
secrets -e -f secrets.yml -o secrets.enc -k $KEY

# decrypt an encrypted file and print to STDOUT:
secrets -d -f secrets.enc -k $KEY
```

#### 2. Ruby

So how would we use this library from another ruby project to encrypt and decrypt values?

After including the `Secrets` module in a ruby class, the class will now have the `#encr` and `#decr` instance methods, as well as `#secret` and `#create_private_key class methods.

Therefore you could write something like this below, protecting a sensitive string using a class-level secret.

```ruby
require 'secrets'
class TestClass
  include Secrets
  key ENV['SECRET']
  
  def sensitive_value=(value)
    @sensitive_value = encr(value, self.class.private_key)
  end
  def sensitive_value
    decr(@sensitive_value, self.class.private_key)
  end
end
```

## Managing Keys

There is a separate discussion about ways to securely store private keys in [MANAGING-KEYS.md](https://github.com/kigster/secrets-cipher-base64/blob/master/MANAGING-KEYS.md).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
